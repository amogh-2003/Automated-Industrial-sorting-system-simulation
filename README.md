# Automated-Industrial-sorting-system-simulation

This project is a **Pygame-based simulation** of an **industrial conveyor sorting system**, developed at **Acubiq Pvt Ltd**.    
It demonstrates how packages can be **detected, classified, and sorted** automatically using simulated **weight, color, and size sensors**, along with an actuator arm mechanism.

---

##  Features
- **Conveyor Belt Simulation** with animated stripes for realism.  
- **Three Sensor Modes**:  
  - ⚖ **Weight Sensor** → Sorts based on weight ranges.  
  - 🎨 **Color Sensor** → Sorts by package color.  
  - 📏 **Size Sensor** → Sorts by package size.  
- **Interactive Mode Switching** via button panel (clickable in the GUI).  
- **Actuator Arm Animation** to move packages onto the correct output belt.  
- **Multiple Output Belts (4)** with live counters:
  - Current packages
  - Assigned count
  - Processed count
- **Real-time HUD** showing:
  - Mode in use  
  - Total spawned, assigned, processed, and unsorted packages  
- **Logging** (`system.log`) for sensor readings, actuator actions, and mode changes.
